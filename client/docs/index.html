  <h1>Documentation</h1>
  <p>Hello user, welcome to the developer documentation for Frog OS. This documentation will cover how to create your
    own app for Frog OS. Some things you will need include </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Basic web development experience (HTML, CSS, Javascript)</li>
    <li>A human brain</li>
    <li>The attention span of more than a goldfish</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Now with that out of the way we may continue.</p>
  <h2>App repo syntax</h2>
  <p>If you want to start creating apps for Frog OS the first step will be to create an repo for your apps. These repos
    can be hosted anywhere really as long as you have the ability to create a repo.json file somewhere on your server. There will be an example repo linked <a href="/docs/repo.json">here</a>
